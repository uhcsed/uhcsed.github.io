# Getting Started

## Adding Content

**Please don't commit directly to master. Instead, create a pull request (PR) and then notify the website czar.**

1. Create a new branch from master: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
2. Add and commit your changes. `git status` to check what you did, `git add ...` to add new files, `git commit -m "Put a comprehensive summary of your changes here"`
3. Push your new branch: `git push` (depending on your settings, git will complain and tell you what to do instead).
4. Go to https://github.com/kixlab/kixlab.github.io and create a new Pull Request for your branch.
5. Someone with authority will go on and merge your changes.
